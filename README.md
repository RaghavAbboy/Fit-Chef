# Cursor Fitchef

A Flutter project for FitChef application.

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites
1. Install [Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)
2. Install [Xcode](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835) (for iOS development)
3. Install [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) (for Android development)
4. Install [CocoaPods](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html) (for iOS dependencies):
   ```bash
   sudo gem install cocoapods
   ```

### Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd cursor_fitchef
   ```

2. Run the setup script (see [Scripts](#project-scripts) section for details):
   ```bash
   ./setup.sh
   ```
   This will verify required tools, install dependencies, and prepare the project.

3. (Manual alternative) Install Flutter dependencies:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

4. (Manual alternative) Install iOS dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd ios
   pod install
   cd ..
   ```

5. Setup simulators/emulators:
   - For iOS: Open Xcode, go to Xcode > Open Developer Tool > Simulator
   - For Android: Open Android Studio > Tools > Device Manager > Create Device

### Running the App (iOS, Android, Web)

You can run the app on different platforms using the provided script:

- **iOS Simulator:**
  ```bash
  ./run_app.sh ios
  ```
  (Opens the iOS Simulator and runs the app)

- **Android Emulator:**
  ```bash
  ./run_app.sh android <android_device_id>
  ```
  (Start your Android emulator from Android Studio or with `flutter emulators`. Replace `<android_device_id>` with your device ID.)

- **Web (Chrome):**
  ```bash
  ./run_app.sh web
  ```
  (This will launch the app in Google Chrome on port 3000 by default. Make sure your Supabase and Google Cloud redirect URIs use port 3000.)

To see all available devices:
```bash
flutter devices
```

**Tip:** To log the output of any command you run (for sharing or debugging), use the `run_and_log.sh` script as described in the Project Scripts section below.

## Project Scripts

This project provides several scripts to automate common tasks. Make sure each script is executable:
```bash
chmod +x setup.sh git_push.sh git_pull.sh run_app.sh
```

| Script           | Purpose                                                                                 | Usage Example                                  |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `setup.sh`       | Sets up the Flutter project: checks for tools, installs dependencies, cleans builds.     | `./setup.sh`                                   |
| `git_push.sh`    | Stashes changes, pulls latest, restores changes, adds, commits, and pushes to git.      | `./git_push.sh "your commit message"`          |
| `git_pull.sh`    | Stashes changes, pulls latest from git, restores changes.                               | `./git_pull.sh`                                |
| `run_app.sh`     | Runs the Flutter app in iOS, Android, or Web mode based on the argument provided.       | `./run_app.sh ios`<br>`./run_app.sh android <android_device_id>`<br>`./run_app.sh web` |
| `run_and_log.sh` | Runs any command, logs its output to last_command_output.txt, and prints the output.    | `./run_and_log.sh ls -la`                      |

**Details:**
- `setup.sh`: Ensures your environment is ready for development (Flutter, CocoaPods, dependencies, clean build).
- `git_push.sh`: Automates the process of safely pushing your changes to the current git branch. Requires a commit message.
- `git_pull.sh`: Safely pulls the latest changes from the current git branch, preserving your local changes.
- `run_app.sh`: Runs the Flutter app in the selected mode: iOS (opens Simulator), Android (requires device ID), or Web (Chrome browser).
- `run_and_log.sh`: Runs any command you provide, logs its output (stdout and stderr) to `last_command_output.txt` (overwriting previous output), and prints the output to the terminal. Useful for sharing command output with others or for debugging.

# Web mode uses port 3000 by default.

## Common Issues and Solutions

- If you encounter CocoaPods issues:
  ```bash
  cd ios
  pod deintegrate
  pod setup
  pod install
  ```

- If Flutter doctor shows issues:
  ```bash
  flutter doctor
  ```
  Follow the recommendations to resolve any issues.
